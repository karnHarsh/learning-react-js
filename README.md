### React
A JavaScript **library** for building user interfaces (UI)

- *Declarative*: useful for creating interactive UIs, using React state, right components are updated and rendered when data is changed
- *Component-Based*: build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- *Learn Once, Write Anywhere*: if you learn web app development using ReactJS, then you will adapt with mobile development using React Native pretty quickly.
